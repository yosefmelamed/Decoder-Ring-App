# Decoder-Ring-App
JavaScript based app with three functions for creating and decoding a message.
Researched various solutions for manupulating arrays and strings in order to create and decode the message.
Discovered a concise solution for breaking an array into  smaller array chunks.
Includes three functions, Ceasar shift shifts letters to the left or right, Polybius transfers letteres to corresponding numbers and back, and substitution substitutes 
message letters based on a corresponding code alphabet.
Possibly incorporate additional coding methods in the future.
